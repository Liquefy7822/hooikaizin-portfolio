Volunteering has always been something I deeply value, and I am grateful for opportunities that allow me to give back to the community. One such experience was when my friend hosted a volunteering opportunity at Willing Hearts, a charity that prepares and delivers meals to elderly individuals who are bedridden or unable to leave their homes to buy food.

During my time there in Secondary 1 and 2, my friends and I took on different roles to assist in meal preparation. Some days, we washed dishes, while on others, we helped chop vegetables that would be cooked for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We were also given the chance to package sambal, which was later sold to raise funds for charity, further supporting those in need.

This experience was both fun and eye-opening, as I saw firsthand the dedication and hard work that goes into running a charity. The volunteers would wake up very early to prepare food, ensuring that no elderly person would go hungry. It was inspiring to witness their commitment, perseverance, and sense of responsibilityâ€”values that I learned and carried with me from this experience.

Beyond giving back to the community, I also bonded more with my classmates, working together towards a common goal. This experience reinforced my passion for helping others, and I hope to continue making a difference in the lives of those in need.
