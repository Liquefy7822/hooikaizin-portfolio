Volunteering has always been something close to my heart, and I find great fulfillment in giving back to the community. One memorable experience was when my class participated in a food drive hosted by Hao Ren Hao Shi, where we distributed essential food items to the needy at an HDB void deck. Beyond simply handing out food, we also wanted to bring joy to the children, so we organized activities such as a magnetic fishing game booth, which they thoroughly enjoyed.

In addition to engaging with the community, we also assisted the elderly and frail by carrying their food items to their homes, knowing that these essentials, though necessary, could be too heavy for them to manage on their own. Through this experience, I gained a deeper understanding of economic disparities and how many people struggle with daily necessities. It made me more empathetic, open-minded, and appreciative of the privileges I have.

This experience reinforced my passion for helping others, showing me that even small actions can make a big difference. Moving forward, I hope to continue contributing to society, whether through similar outreach programs or other initiatives that bring people together and offer support to those in need.
