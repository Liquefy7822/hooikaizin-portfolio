When I first heard about the gardening workshop organized by my school, I signed up with my friend without hesitation. I wanted to make a positive change in my school and, as someone who is usually introverted, this was one of the few times I actively volunteered for something. I saw this as an opportunity to step out of my comfort zone and become more involved.

On the first day, we visited City Sprouts, an urban farming area filled with different types of plants and even farm animals like chickens. This was an eye-opening experience because urban farming is rare in Singapore, and seeing it firsthand was both fascinating and inspiring. I was particularly amazed to learn that some of the plants were edible, something I had never considered before.

One of the most valuable lessons I took away was composting. We learned about the different stages of composting, its benefits and drawbacks, and how to create an effective compost. Taking this knowledge back to school, we decided to set up our very first compost bin, which I was proud to supervise alongside my fellow volunteers. Gathering the necessary materials and successfully creating compost for our school felt like a significant achievement.

To further expand my knowledge, I signed up for a gardening class that lasted two weeks. During this time, we explored various ways to maximize plant growth, such as pruning stems to encourage taller growth and identifying signs of plant diseases and pests. Inspired by this, our school decided to start a garden, where we planted species like mint and other herbs. My team and I were responsible for supervising and maintaining the plants, ensuring they remained healthy.

This experience deepened my passion for problem-solving and innovation, leading me to think about how technology could be integrated into urban farming. As someone interested in electronics, I began researching automated gardening systems that use sensors to monitor soil moisture, light levels, and temperature. This sparked my curiosity about how IoT (Internet of Things) technology can improve farming efficiency and sustainability.

Through this experience, I not only gained hands-on gardening knowledge but also found a new way to connect my interest in electronics with real-world applications. In the future, I hope to explore how smart systems and automation can contribute to urban farming solutions, making agriculture more efficient and sustainable.
