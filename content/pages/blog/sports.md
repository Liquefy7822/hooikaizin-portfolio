Floorball has been an integral part of my life, shaping me both as a player and a person. I first started playing in primary school, competing in multiple tournaments, and when I entered secondary school, I was determined to continue my passion. Choosing floorball as my CCA was an easy decision, and over the past seven years, I have grown tremendously through the sport.

The transition from primary to secondary school came with a steep learning curve, as the expectations and competition intensity increased. In Secondary 1, I competed in my first National School Games (NSG), where we faced Raffles Institution, a school known for its exceptional floorball team. Though we suffered a heavy defeat, it was a turning point for meâ€”I realized my weaknesses and became more determined to improve. From then on, I dedicated time and effort to mastering my techniques, competing in NSG for the next three years and constantly pushing myself to do better.

Beyond skill development, floorball has also helped me grow as a person. Initially, in Secondary 1, I was shy and introverted, preferring to practice alone rather than interact with my teammates. However, by Secondary 3, I saw how closely bonded our CCA was, and with the support of my friends, I decided to step out of my comfort zone. I joined the EXCO committee and was honored to become Vice-Captain. Leading my team in competitions and training sessions taught me invaluable lessons about teamwork, perseverance, and leadership.

While there were both wins and losses, what mattered most was the growth and lessons learned along the way. Floorball holds a special place in my heart because of the strong camaraderie and shared values within the team. The unwavering support from my teammates and seniors has made my journey even more meaningful, and I am grateful for the opportunities to lead, guide juniors, and contribute to this amazing CCA.

Looking back, I am proud of how much I have grown and deeply appreciate the friendships, experiences, and lessons that floorball has given me. It has been a transformative journey, and I will always cherish the memories and values I have gained from this sport.
