  It’s hard to imagine that I’ve that I wrote all this code by myself, probably
  because I worked with an entire team :) but they definitely followed my lead
  most of the time.

### 3-Day Course Experience: Innovation and Workplace Safety

On the first day, we embarked on a learning journey to 3M Innoscience, where we explored various innovative technologies and materials developed by 3M. This visit provided insights into how science and engineering drive problem-solving in different industries, from healthcare to construction. We learned about cutting-edge materials, workplace safety solutions, and how 3M fosters innovation through research and development.

On the second day, we began our project under the theme "(RE)designed to Improve Workplace Safety and Security." Our team focused on the issue of preventing heat stroke in construction sites. Our solution was a smart cooling vest equipped with:

*   A thermal sensor to monitor body temperature.

*   A buzzer alert to notify workers when they are overheating.

*   A buckle-strap fan system to help cool the worker down.

Although we only developed an online prototype due to time constraints, we envisioned creating a physical prototype in the future. Given more time, we would have tested different materials and refined our design for practical implementation.

This experience taught me valuable skills and lessons, such as applying science and technology to solve real-world problems, especially in the context of climate and workplace safety. Beyond technical skills, I also learned the importance of teamwork and communication, as working collaboratively allowed us to refine our ideas and problem-solve effectively.

Although I did not win, I found the experience incredibly rewarding and inspiring, as it pushed me to think critically and creatively about real-world challenges while working alongside like-minded peers.
