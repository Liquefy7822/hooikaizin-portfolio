  It’s hard to imagine that I’ve that I wrote all this code by myself, probably
  because I worked with an entire team :) but they definitely followed my lead
  most of the time.

*   ### Battling Climate Change with IoT and Electronics Solutions

*   As part of a learning journey to SiT, my team worked on a project addressing climate change-induced soil erosion caused by heavy rain. Using IoT technology and embedded electronics, we developed a prototype to detect rain moisture levels and identify potential landslides. At the core of our system was the STM32 microcontroller, which interfaced with various sensors—including a moisture sensor to assess soil saturation and a light sensor to detect landslides when soil movement covered it. These sensors provided real-time data, which was transmitted to ThingSpeak and displayed on a custom website for monitoring, enabling timely intervention in high-risk areas.

*   Despite challenges such as limited time and insufficient data on different soil types, we explored electronic optimizations to improve sensor accuracy. We also proposed integrating solar panels for sustainability and testing different soil compositions in a controlled landslide experiment to enhance reliability.

*   ### Learning and Reflection

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in electronics and IoT systems, from sensor integration and circuit design to microcontroller programming. This deepened my understanding of how electronics can be leveraged for environmental monitoring, an area I hope to explore further. Beyond technical skills, I also learned the importance of teamwork and effective communication in refining our prototype and coordinating tasks efficiently. Our efforts culminated in a functional system and a well-executed presentation, ultimately securing first place in the competition. This experience solidified my passion for electronics and embedded systems, reinforcing my belief in their potential to solve real-world challenges, from climate change to automation and beyond.
