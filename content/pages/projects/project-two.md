  It’s hard to imagine that I’ve that I wrote all this code by myself, probably
  because I worked with an entire team :) but they definitely followed my lead
  most of the time.

Our project aimed to tackle the issue of food wastage, which often happens when people buy too much food or forget expiry dates, leading to unnecessary waste. We identified this as a significant problem, especially in households where food is frequently discarded due to poor tracking of expiration dates.

To address this, we designed a smart food tracking system using Arduino. Our solution involved:

*   A box equipped with a barcode scanner that scans food packaging.

*   An app that receives the scanned data and displays expiry dates, helping users keep track of their food items.

*   A reminder system to notify users before food expires, encouraging them to use it in time.

Although we only created a digital prototype, we envisioned developing a physical working model with more time. Given further resources, we would have conducted real-world testing to refine its practicality and effectiveness.

Through this experience, I gained valuable technical and problem-solving skills, learning how to apply technology to real-world issues like food waste. More importantly, I developed teamwork and communication skills, as collaborating with my team was essential in refining our ideas and ensuring a well-thought-out solution.

Although I did not win, the experience was extremely rewarding, as it challenged me to think creatively, work efficiently under time constraints, and develop a greater awareness of food sustainability.
